1. Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"
2. Line 13 prints: "final result: 20" 
3. Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"
4. he code will return an error because result is only defined in the block scope inside of the if conditional statement. It is not defined outside of that block, which is why the program will error.
5. The program will error because we can not reassign the value of result after declaring it to be 0 with a "const" keyword. Since result is a "constant" variable, we can not reassign that value to "result = num1 + num2".
6. Line 13 will not run because the program would have already errored on line 9 due to the attempt of reassigning a constant error. Since the program already errors on line 9, it will not reach line 13 of the program.
